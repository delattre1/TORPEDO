# Scout operations

## 1. Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose.
- Linux, or WSL when operating from Windows. The release suite validates POSIX
  shell scripts and is not supported from native Windows Python.
- A Plow agent line and the `plow-credentials` file minted by the official `plow-agents` flow.
- A Mac connected through Plow Latch for live reconnaissance.
- An Agent Index agent identifier assigned by the official client.

Never commit `plow-credentials`, `.env`, SQLite files, browser handles, vault values, or copied callback URLs containing tokens. The repository ignores the common local forms of these files.

## 2. Verify and build

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q skills/scout/scripts tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
docker compose config --quiet
docker build --pull -t scout:local .
```

The Agent Index client and its `agent-index` reporter service come with the Plow base image.

## 3. Start the agent

Place the official credential file at `./plow-credentials`, then set the registered ID and start the service:

```bash
export AGENT_ID=scout-your-registered-id
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f agent
```

The persistent `agent-home` volume owns `$HERMES_HOME`, including `scout/scout.db` and the official Agent Index installation identity. Rebuilding the image must not delete this volume.

Before starting a demo, run this preflight:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail 100 agent
docker compose exec agent /opt/hermes/.venv/bin/python3 \
  /opt/plow/agent-index-client.py status
```

Do not proceed when the reporter says `AGENT_ID is empty`, the client says the
installation is not registered, or the Plow MCP connection remains parked.
Configure the registered ID, verify the official credential flow and the active
Mac/Latch connection, then recreate the service and repeat the preflight.

## 4. User flow in Plow Chat

Send either:

```text
Scout this: https://target.example/process
```

or:

```text
Scout what it takes to complete <goal>.
```

Scout creates a mission before browsing, reads the current Latch browsing skill, requests the minimum origin scope, then repeats screenshot → inspect → record → link → checkpoint → classify → navigate. A normal completion report is impossible without durable evidence and a checkpoint.

## 5. Authentication and human handoff

Scout checks the copied browser profile first. If no session exists, it lists vault metadata for the current site, asks approval for the minimum item, widens the browser session for that item, and fills with `fill_secret`. The value is never returned to the model or written to SQLite.

CAPTCHA, missing login, identity verification, denied scope, and required human decisions are `BLOCKED`, not generic failures. After the owner acts, Scout resolves the stored blocker, reloads the last checkpoint, verifies the live page with a screenshot, and resumes `RECON`.

## 6. Safety boundary

Scout may inspect dangerous controls but may not activate them. Every proposed browser action goes through `safety_check.py`. Final submission, purchase, payment, subscription, cancellation, deletion, publishing, external messages, signing, contract acceptance, legal attestation, and consequential identity verification stop the route.

Do not weaken a golden safety case to make a demo pass. Change the target or stop earlier.

## 7. Agent Index checks

The s6 longrun waits for `plow-init`, uses the official client to distinguish registered, unregistered, and unreadable local state, registers only when needed, and reports every five minutes. It never implements its own install ID or telemetry payload.

After the real container is running, inspect its logs and official status:

```bash
docker compose logs agent | grep agent-index
docker compose exec agent /opt/hermes/.venv/bin/python3 \
  /opt/plow/agent-index-client.py status
```

Confirmation in the remote Agent Index is an external acceptance gate; local logs alone are not proof of ingestion.

Record the remote confirmation and each live demo in
`docs/ACCEPTANCE_RECORD.md`. Store only timestamps, mission IDs, non-sensitive
target names, redacted artifact references, and the observed pass/fail result.
Never paste credentials, browser handles, vault values, private screenshots, or
token-bearing URLs into the record.

## 8. Troubleshooting

- Browser call blocked: report Latch's own diagnosis; do not work around the approval system.
- Unknown redirect: record it, classify scope extension, request only the observed origin.
- Browser disappeared: load the active mission and last checkpoint; never reconstruct state from chat.
- 401/403/429 in `failed_requests`: record evidence/blocker and avoid aggressive retries.
- SQLite write/checkpoint failed: stop all browser actions until persistence works.
- Agent Index state unreadable: do not re-register over it; preserve the home volume and inspect the client error.
- `AGENT_ID is empty`: export the registered identifier in the shell that runs
  Compose, recreate the service, and confirm the value is no longer reported as
  empty. Do not substitute an install key or credential token for the agent ID.
- Plow MCP repeatedly parked: confirm that the credential file came from the
  current official flow and that the approved Mac/Latch endpoint is online;
  keep the external gates open until a real browser call succeeds.
